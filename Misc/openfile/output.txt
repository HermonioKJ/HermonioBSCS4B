1
The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be.

2
Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us

3
-- there is a tingling in the spine,

4
a catch in the voice,

5
a faint sensation,

6
as if a distant memory,

7
of falling from a great height.

8
We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.
