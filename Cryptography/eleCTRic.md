## Solution:

Connecting to the service, we can choose to encrypt, decrypt or list files.

If we start by listing files, we see the flag file is already there:
```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Radixs_Terminal# nc 2018shell3.picoctf.com 15037
Initializing Problem...
Welcome to eleCTRic Ltd's Safe Crypto Storage
---------------------------------------------

Choices:
  E[n]crypt and store file
  D[e]crypt file
  L[i]st files
  E[x]it
Please choose: i

Files:
  flag_5747f8d4060b328f0fbc.txt
```

However, in order to decrypt it, we need the encrypted name of the file, which is received only during encryption:
```
Choices:
  E[n]crypt and store file
  D[e]crypt file
  L[i]st files
  E[x]it
Please choose: n

Name of file? test
Data? a
Share code:
HzoBdxcjpWM=

Choices:
  E[n]crypt and store file
  D[e]crypt file
  L[i]st files
  E[x]it
Please choose: e

Share code? HzoBdxcjpWM=
Data:
a
```

According to the source code, encryption is performed by AES-CTR:
```python
cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=lambda: self.ctr)
```

However, the counter is implemented as a constant, when in fact it should change for each block (more about this [here](https://ctftime.org/writeup/7199)):
```python
        self.ctr = random.read(AES.block_size)
```

This means that instead of a stream cipher, AES-CTR is being reduced to a block cipher where throughout each session, the nth block of the plaintext will always be encrypted to the same ciphertext. Furthermore, the encrypted nth block of two plaintexts which differ by x bytes will only differ by x bytes as well.

Let's see an example:
```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Radixs_Terminal# nc 2018shell3.picoctf.com 15037
Initializing Problem...
Welcome to eleCTRic Ltd's Safe Crypto Storage
---------------------------------------------

Choices:
  E[n]crypt and store file
  D[e]crypt file
  L[i]st files
  E[x]it
Please choose: n

Name of file? test
Data? a
Share code:
xrJuQaPVc2o=

Choices:
  E[n]crypt and store file
  D[e]crypt file
  L[i]st files
  E[x]it
Please choose: n

Name of file? tess
Data? b
Share code:
xrJuRqPVc2o=

Choices:
  E[n]crypt and store file
  D[e]crypt file
  L[i]st files
  E[x]it
Please choose: x

root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Radixs_Terminal# echo "xrJuQaPVc2o=" | base64 -d && echo
틀nAsj
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Radixs_Terminal# echo "xrJuRqPVc2o=" | base64 -d && echo
틀nFsj
```

We can see that "test" got encrypted to "틀nAsj", and "tess" got encrypted to "틀nFsj", where only the "A" and "F" differ.

So, if the name of the flag file is "flag_5747f8d4060b328f0fbc.txt", we can encrypt a file called "flagX5747f8d4060b328f0fbc.txt" and then brute force all possibilities for the encrypted byte in X's location until we get the correct one.

The code:
```python
from pwn import *
import base64
import re

r = remote("2018shell3.picoctf.com", 15037)

def list_files():
	log.info("Listing files")
	r.sendlineafter("Please choose:", "i")
	r.recvuntil("Files:")
	out = r.recvuntil("\n\n")
	return out

def encrypt(file_name, data):
	log.info("Encrypting file: Name: '{}', Data: '{}'".format(file_name, data))
	r.sendlineafter("Please choose:", "n")
	r.sendlineafter("Name of file? ", file_name)
	r.sendlineafter("Data? ", data)
	r.recvline()
	code = r.recvline()
	log.info("Base64 Code: {}".format(code))
	return code


def decrypt(file_name):
	log.info("Requesting to decrypt file '{}'".format(file_name))
	r.sendlineafter("Please choose:", "e")
	r.sendlineafter("Share code? ", file_name)
	line = r.recvline()
	if "Data:" in line:
		until = "Choices:"
		out = r.recvuntil(until)
		return out[:-len(until)].rstrip()
	elif "Could not find file" in line:
		log.warning("File not found")
		return None


out = list_files()
flag_match = re.search("(flag_[^.]+)\.txt", out)
flag_basename = flag_match.group(1)

log.info("Flag file: {}".format(flag_basename))

code_b64 = encrypt(flag_basename.replace("_", "X"), "a")
code = base64.b64decode(code_b64)

log.info("Code: {}".format(enhex(code)))

for i in range(256):
	x = code[:4] + chr(i) + code[5:]
	if x == code:
		continue
	out = decrypt(base64.b64encode(x))
	if out is not None:
		log.success("Flag: {}".format(out))
		break
		
```

The output:
