# What's your input

Note: very sketchy writeup because I don't know why what I did got a flag, it just worked

## Description

We'd like to get your input on a couple things. Think you can answer my questions correctly? [in.py](./in.py) nc mercury.picoctf.net 61858.

## Hints

1. What version of python am I running?

## Approach

`nc mercury.picoctf.net 61858` to connect to server. I took a look at `in.py` and noticed the `city` variable would be something that's unavailable to us. Upon careful inspection, it seems no matter what number is given, as long as it isn't nothing (or not a number) then it will continue onto the next section. I didn't know which cities were in the file `city_names.txt` so I just inputted "city" and it gave a flag.

## Flag

picoCTF{v4lua4bl3_1npu7_7607377}
