## Description:
> The most revolutionary game is finally available: seed sPRiNG is open right now!


## Solution:

Let's start by running the program:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/seed-sPRiNG# ./seed_spring



                          #                mmmmm  mmmmm    "    mm   m   mmm
  mmm    mmm    mmm    mmm#          mmm   #   "# #   "# mmm    #"m  # m"   "
 #   "  #"  #  #"  #  #" "#         #   "  #mmm#" #mmmm"   #    # #m # #   mm
  """m  #""""  #""""  #   #          """m  #      #   "m   #    #  # # #    #
 "mmm"  "#mm"  "#mm"  "#m##         "mmm"  #      #    " mm#mm  #   ##  "mmm"



Welcome! The game is easy: you jump on a sPRiNG.
How high will you fly?

LEVEL (1/30)

Guess the height: 1
WRONG! Sorry, better luck next time!
```

We need to guess a number chosen by the program - but if we guess incorrectly, we get thrown. In order to receive the flag, we must guess 30 values.

The Ghidra decompiler shows us the following output:
```c
undefined4 main(undefined1 param_1)
{
  uint local_20;
  uint local_1c;
  uint local_18;
  int local_14;
  undefined1 *local_10;
  
  local_10 = &param_1;
  puts("");
  puts("");
  puts("                                                                             ");
  puts("                          #                mmmmm  mmmmm    \"    mm   m   mmm ");
  puts("  mmm    mmm    mmm    mmm#          mmm   #   \"# #   \"# mmm    #\"m  # m\"   \"");
  puts(" #   \"  #\"  #  #\"  #  #\" \"#         #   \"  #mmm#\" #mmmm\"   #    # #m # #   mm");
  puts(
      "  \"\"\"m  #\"\"\"\"  #\"\"\"\"  #   #          \"\"\"m  #      #   \"m   #    #  # # #    #"
      );
  puts(" \"mmm\"  \"#mm\"  \"#mm\"  \"#m##         \"mmm\"  #      #    \" mm#mm  #   ##  \"mmm\"");
  puts("                                                                             ");
  puts("");
  puts("");
  puts("Welcome! The game is easy: you jump on a sPRiNG.");
  puts("How high will you fly?");
  puts("");
  fflush(stdout);
  local_18 = time((time_t *)0x0);
  srand(local_18);
  local_14 = 1;
  while( true ) {
    if (0x1e < local_14) {
      puts("Congratulation! You\'ve won! Here is your flag:\n");
      get_flag();
      fflush(stdout);
      return 0;
    }
    printf("LEVEL (%d/30)\n",local_14);
    puts("");
    local_1c = rand();
    local_1c = local_1c & 0xf;
    printf("Guess the height: ");
    fflush(stdout);
    __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00010c9a,&local_20);
    fflush(stdin);
    if (local_1c != local_20) break;
    local_14 = local_14 + 1;
  }
  puts("WRONG! Sorry, better luck next time!");
  fflush(stdout);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(-1);
}
```

It looks like the program calls `srand` providing a seed which is basically the current time. All the values returned by `rand()` throughout the program are based on this seed, and if we enter the same seed we will receive the same values. So, all we need to do is create another program which calls `srand(time(0))` at the same time, allowing us to feed the output of our program to `seed_spring`.

```c
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <time.h>
#include <stdlib.h> 
  
int main () 
{ 
    int i;
      
    srand(time(0)); 
    
    for (i = 0; i < 30; i++)
    {
        printf("%d\n", rand() & 0xf); 
    }
      
    return 0; 
} 
```

Note that we need to run this on the server in order to receive the same time the program does.
