First, let us do a simple _file_ and _strings_ command to check what the given file contains:

The file looks like it is an MS executable file, let’s find a way to run it. Let’s try adding a _.exe_ to the filename and see:

Hey, looks like it works but seems to be stuck on some condition? Well, let’s import the file to Ghidra and take a look inside:
![[Pasted image 20231015215556.png]]
Good news, we found the function that printout our flag. Bad news, look like the function is obfuscated and the flag seems to hide behind some condition? Let’s try checking that first:
![[Pasted image 20231015215613.png]]
The condition takes the variable _DVar1_ and compares it to _0x1e0a_, the warning when we initially run the file seems to come from this. Also, the _DVar1_ variable look like it takes the value of this file size… wait could it be that we need to modify the file size to bypass it??! Like making it **BIGGER!?**

Let’s check the value of _0x1e0a_ and our current file size then:
	![[Pasted image 20231015215622.png]]
Converting the hex value into decimals, we got _7690_ as our value. Now let’s check our current file size:![[Pasted image 20231015215631.png]]
I see now… looks like our current file size is a little less than 10 bytes on what our condition wanted, let’s try making it bigger by simply adding the zero:
![[Pasted image 20231015215638.png]]
Simply adding 10 bytes of zero, let us see if we can bypass the challenge condition now:
![[Pasted image 20231015215647.png]]

…aaaaaand success!! We succeedingly make the file **bigger** and got our flag: **flag(fi1e_si2e_i$_ch@ngeable)**
